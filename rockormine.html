		<h3>Rock vs Mine Prediction</h3>

		<p>Using Sonar detected Datasets of different Bedrocks I try and predict the components of the stone detected. 
		<br>
		<br>
		
The discovery of rocks and minerals would have been very difficult past  the development of the SONAR technique, which relays on certain parameters to be able  to detect the obstacle or the surface is a rock or a mine.
<br>
<br>

Machine learning has drawn the  attention of maximum  part of  the technology related and based  industries, by  showing  advancements in the predictive analytics. The main aim is to emanate a capable prediction  representative, united by the machine learning algorithmic characteristics, which can figure out if the target of the sound wave is either a rock or a mine or any other organism or any kind of other body. 
<br>
<br>

This attempt is a clear-cut case study which comes up with a machine learning plan for the grading of rocks and minerals, executed on a huge, highly spatial and complex SONAR dataset. The attempts are done on highly spatial SONAR dataset and achieved  an  accuracy of  83.17% and  AUC came  out to  be 0.92.  With random  forest algorithm, the  results are  further optimized by  feature selection to  get the accuracy  of 90%.
